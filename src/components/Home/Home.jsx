            <h3>Hands-Off is a tool for aspiring content-creators looking to protect their brand</h3>
            <p>The tool itself does a few things but the biggest thing is ensuring you get first dibs on your streaming-content. All you have to do is click end stream and your content is automatically uploaded to your content-creation accounts on other platforms. This process is able to be customized specifically for you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can add a custom intro for each stream</li>
                <li>You can add a custom description for each stream</li>
                <li>You can automatically link all of your socials on other platforms</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        </>
